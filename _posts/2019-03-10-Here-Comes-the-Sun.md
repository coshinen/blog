## Here Comes the Sun | 太陽從這兒升起

歌手：The Beatles<br>
作詞：George Harrison<br>
作曲：George Harrison

Here comes the sun (doo doo doo doo)<br>
Here comes the sun, and I say<br>
It's all right

Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter<br>
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here<br>
Here comes the sun<br>
Here comes the sun, and I say<br>
It's all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces<br>
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here<br>
Here comes the sun<br>
Here comes the sun, and I say<br>
It's all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes<br>
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes<br>
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes<br>
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes<br>
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting<br>
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear<br>
Here comes the sun<br>
Here comes the sun, and I say<br>
It's all right

Here comes the sun<br>
Here comes the sun, and I say<br>
It's all right<br>
It's all right

Thanks for your time.
