## Tonight, I feel close to you | 今晚，我感覺離你很近

歌手：倉木麻衣・孫燕姿<br>
作詞：Mai Kuraki・Tokiko Nishimuro<br>
作曲：Aika Ohno

Close my eyes and feel your mind<br>
Time has passed<br>
I walk like a shadow<br>
Never knew<br>
What I am going through<br>
You touch my heart and take my breath away

Whisper on the wind so softly<br>
Let the bright stars fill out dreams with love<br>
Reach for your hand (you're holding my key)<br>
and you show me the way

Tonight, I feel close to you<br>
You open my door and light the sky above<br>
When I need a friend, you are there right by my side<br>
I wish we could stay as one<br>
I wish we could stay forever as one

All the tears that haunt my past<br>
You promised<br>
It'll be better tomorrow<br>
play that song<br>
You and I listened to<br>
And let it gently ease our pain

Tender rain drops from the blue sky<br>
Flowers blooming, life is so divine<br>
like sunlight on a stream (you'reholding my key)<br>
You show the world to me

Tonight, I feel close to you<br>
You open my door and light the sky above<br>
When I need a friend, you are there right by my side<br>
I wish we could stay as one

So much love in this beautiful world<br>
Search for the brightest star in the sky<br>
You will find the meaning of love<br>
Don't be afraid (Don't be afraid), Just be yourself (Just be yourself)<br>
We need this love... I've never knew

Tonight, I feel close to you<br>
You open my door and light the sky above<br>
When I need a friend, you are there right by my side<br>
I wish we could stay as one

Tonight, I feel close to you<br>
You open my door and light the sky above<br>
When I need a friend, you are there right by my side<br>
I wish we could stay as one<br>
I wish we could stay forever as one

Thanks for your time.
