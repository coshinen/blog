## Season 1 Episode 1, Winter Is Coming

> Tyrion Lannister (The Imp):
> Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor,
> and it can never be used to hurt you.

## Season 2 Episode 3, What Is Dead May Never Die

> Varys:
> Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the
> wall, and a very smell man can cast a very large shadow.

## Season 3 Episode 4, And Now His Watch Is Ended

> Tywin Lannister:
> I don't distrust you because you're a woman. I distrust you because you're not
> as smart as you think you are.

## Season 3 Episode 6, The Climb

> Petyr Baelish (Littlefinger):
> Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail, and never
> get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some are given a chance to climb,
> but they refuse. They cling to the realm, or the gods, or love. Illusions.
> Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.

## Season 4 Episode 5, First of His Name

> Sandor Clegane (The Hound):
> Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going. Better than most.

## Season 7 Episode 1, Dragonstone

> Jon Snow:
> Everything before the word "but" is horse shit.

## Season 7 Episode 7, The Dragon and the Wolf

> Sansa Stark:
> I'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn.
