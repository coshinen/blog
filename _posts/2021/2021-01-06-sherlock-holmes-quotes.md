> "You see," he explained, "I consider that a man's brain originally is like a
> little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you
> choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so
> that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best
> is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying
> his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what
> he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may
> help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in
> the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has
> elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time
> when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew
> before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts
> elbowing out the useful ones."

> He smiled gently. "It is of the first importance," he said, "not to allow your
> judgment to be biased by personal qualities. A client is to me a mere unit—a
> factor in a problem. The emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear
> reasoning. I assure you that the most winning woman I ever knew was hanged for
> poisoning three little children for their insurance-money, and the most
> repellant man of my acquaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a
> quarter of a million upon the London poor."

> suit facts.

> It is not really difficult to construct a series of inferences, each dependent
> upon its predecessor and each simple in itself. If, after doing so, one simply
> knocks out all the central inferences and presents one's audience with the
> starting-point and the conclusion, one may produce a startling, though
> possibly a meretricious, effect.
