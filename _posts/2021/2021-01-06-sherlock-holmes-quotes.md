## [A Study In Scarlet, Part I, II: The Science Of Deduction](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/a-study-in-scarlet/text/chapter-1-2){:target="_blank"}

> "You see," he explained, "I consider that a man's brain originally is like a
> little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you
> choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so
> that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best
> is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying
> his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what
> he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may
> help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in
> the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has
> elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time
> when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew
> before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts
> elbowing out the useful ones."

“你看，”他解释道，“我认为一个人的大脑本来就像一个空荡荡的阁楼，你必须选择家具来储存它。
愚者会把遇到的所有废旧家具都放进去，以至于那些可能对他有用的知识都挤到外面，或者顶多是和许多其他的东西混在一起，以至于他很难把手放在上面。
现在这个技术娴熟的工人确实非常小心地把东西放进他的大脑阁楼。
他除了能帮助他工作的工具外，什么都没有，但他有很多种类的这些工具，而且都排列的井井有条。
认为那个小房间有弹性的墙壁并可以膨胀到任意程度是错误的。
鉴于此总有一天，每增加一点知识，你就会忘记一些你此前知道的事情。
因此，最重要的是，不要让无用的事实挤出有用的事实。“

> There is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination; where there is
> no imagination there is no horror.

这儿是一个激发想象力的奥秘；
没有想象就没有恐怖。

## [The Sign of the Four, I: The Science of Deduction](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-sign-of-the-four/text/chapter-1){:target="_blank"}

> Eliminate all other factors, and the one which remains must be the truth.

排除所有其他因素，剩下的一定是真相。

> No, no: I never guess. It is a shocking habit—destructive to the logical
> faculty.

不，不：我从不猜测。
这是一种破坏逻辑能力的非常糟糕的习惯。

## [The Sign of the Four, II: The Statement of the Case](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-sign-of-the-four/text/chapter-2){:target="_blank"}

> He smiled gently. "It is of the first importance," he said, "not to allow your
> judgment to be biased by personal qualities. A client is to me a mere unit—a
> factor in a problem. The emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear
> reasoning. I assure you that the most winning woman I ever knew was hanged for
> poisoning three little children for their insurance-money, and the most
> repellant man of my acquaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a
> quarter of a million upon the London poor."

他轻轻地笑了。
“最重要的是，”他说，“不要让你的判断被个人品质左右。
对我来说客户只是一个单元——是问题的一个因素。
情感品质与清晰的推理是对立的。
我向你保证我认识的最成功的女人因保险金毒害三个小孩而被处以绞刑，而我认识的最令人反感的男人是一位慈善家，他为伦敦的穷人花了近25万英镑。“

## [The Sign of the Four, VI: Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-sign-of-the-four/text/chapter-6){:target="_blank"}

> How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible
> whatever remains, *however improbable*, must be the truth?

我给你说过多少次了，当你除去了不可能的，剩下的，无论多么不可能，都一定是真相？

## [The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, A Scandal in Bohemia, I](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-adventures-of-sherlock-holmes/text/a-scandal-in-bohemia){:target="_blank"}

> You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear.

你看，但你不观察。
两者的区别很明显。

> It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data.
> Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to
> suit facts.

没有数据之前建立理论是一个重大的错误。
不知不觉中人们开始扭曲事实来适应理论，而不是理论去适应事实。

## [The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, A Case of Identity](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-adventures-of-sherlock-holmes/text/a-case-of-identity){:target="_blank"}

> It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the
> most important.

小事永远是最重要的，这一直是我的一条公理。

## [The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Man with the Twisted Lip](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-adventures-of-sherlock-holmes/text/the-man-with-the-twisted-lip){:target="_blank"}

> It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles.

这当然是一桩小事，但没有什么像小事一样重要了。

## [The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, The Final Problem](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-memoirs-of-sherlock-holmes/text/the-final-problem){:target="_blank"}

> " 'You have paid me several compliments, Mr. Moriarty,' said I. 'Let me pay
> you one in return when I say that if I were assured of the former eventuality
> I would, in the interests of the public, cheerfully accept the latter.'

“‘你已经恭维我好几次了，莫里亚蒂先生，’我说。
‘作为回报，我要说，如果我确信了前一种可能性，为了公众的利益，我会欣然接受后者。‘

## [The Return of Sherlock Holmes, The Adventure of the Dancing Men](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-return-of-sherlock-holmes/text/the-adventure-of-the-dancing-men){:target="_blank"}

> It is not really difficult to construct a series of inferences, each dependent
> upon its predecessor and each simple in itself. If, after doing so, one simply
> knocks out all the central inferences and presents one's audience with the
> starting-point and the conclusion, one may produce a startling, though
> possibly a meretricious, effect.

构造一系列推论并不困难，每个推论都依赖它的前身并且每个推论本身都很简单。
如果，这样做之后，一个人只要推敲出所有的中心推论，并把出发点和结论呈现给他的听众，他就可能产生一种令人吃惊的效果，尽管可能留下一种华而不实的，印象。

## A Game of Shadows

> You've paid me several compliments. Let me pay you one in return when I say
> that if I were assured of the former eventuality I would cheerfully accept the
> latter.

## BBC SHERLOCK, Series 1 Episode 2, The Blind Banker

> You want to hide a tree, then a forest is the best place to do it, wouldn't
> you say? People would just walk straight past, not knowing, unable to decipher
> the message.

你想要隐藏一棵树，那么一片森里是最好的地方，你们说呢？
人们只会直接穿过，不知道，也无法解读这信息。

> I don't eat when I'm working. Digesting slows me down.

我工作时不吃东西。
消化会让我慢下来。
