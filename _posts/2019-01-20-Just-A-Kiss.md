## Just A Kiss | 只是一個吻

歌手：Lady Antebellum

Lyin' here with you so close to me<br>
It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe<br>
I'm caught up in this moment<br>
I'm caught up in your smile

I've never opened up to anyone<br>
So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms<br>
We don't need to rush this<br>
Let's just take it slow

Chorus:<br>
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight<br>
Just a touch iof the fire burning so bright<br>
And I don't wanna mess this thing up<br>
I don't wanna push too far<br>
Just a shot in the dark that you just might<br>
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life<br>
So baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight

I know that if we give this a little time<br>
It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find<br>
It's never felt so real, no it's never felt so right

Chorus:<br>
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight<br>
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright<br>
And I don't wanna mess this thing up<br>
I don't wanna push too far<br>
Just a shot in the dark that you just might<br>
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life<br>
So baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight

Bridge:<br>
No I don't wanna say goodnight<br>
I know it's time to leave, but you'll be in my dreams<br>
Tonight<br>
Tonight<br>
Tonight

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight<br>
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright<br>
And I don't wanna mess this thing up<br>
I don't wanna push too far<br>
Just a shot in the dark that you just might<br>
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life<br>
So baby I'm alright, oh, let's do this right, with just a kiss goodnight<br>
With a kiss goodnight<br>
Kiss goodnight

Thanks for your time.
