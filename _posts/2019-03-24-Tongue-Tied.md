## Tongue Tied | 口齒不清

歌手：Grouplove<br>
作詞：Grouplove<br>
作曲：Grouplove

Take me to your best friend's house<br>
Going around this roundabout, oh, yeah<br>
Take me to your best friend's house<br>
I loved you then and I love you now, oh, yeah

Don't take me tongue tied<br>
Don't wave, no goodbye<br>
Don't

Oh, take me to your best friend's house<br>
Marmalade, we're making out, oh, yeah<br>
Take me to your best friend's house<br>
I loved you then and I love you now

Don't take me tongue tied<br>
Don't wave, no goodbye<br>
Don't

One, two, three, four<br>
Don't leave me tongue tied<br>
Let's stay up all night, I'll get real high<br>
Slumber party, pillow fight<br>
My eyes and your eyes<br>
Like Peter Pan up in the sky<br>
My best friend's house tonight<br>
Let's bump the beats 'til beddy-bye<br>

Don't take me tongue tied<br>
Don't wave no goodbye<br>
Don't take me tongue tied<br>
Don't kiss me goodnight<br>
Don't

Take me to your best friend's house<br>
Going around this roundabout, oh, yeah<br>
Oh, take me to your best friend's house<br>
I loved you then and I love you now

Don't leave me tongue tied (Don't leave me)<br>
Don't wave, no goodbyes (Don't leave, no)<br>
Don't leave me tongue tied (Don't leave me)<br>
Don't<br>
Don't leave me tongue tied (Don't leave me)<br>
Don't wave, no goodbye (Don't leave, no)<br>
Don't leave me tongue tied (Don't leave me)<br>
Don't

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Yeah, yeah<br>
Ooh, ooh

## 感想

明天就是 Apple 春季發佈會了，突然想起這首 N 年前 iPod Touch 宣傳片的 BGM。

Thanks for your time.
