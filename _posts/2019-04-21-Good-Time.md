## Good Time | 美好時光

歌手：Owl City<br>
作詞：Adam Young・Matthew Thiessen・Brian Lee<br>
作曲：Adam Young・Matthew Thiessen・Brian Lee

Hmm-mmm-mmm<br>
Whoa-oh-oh-oh<br>
It's always a good time<br>
Whoa-oh-oh-oh<br>
It's always a good time

Woke up on the right side of the bed<br>
What's up with this Prince song inside my head?<br>
Hands up, if you're down to get down tonight<br>
Cause it's always a good time<br>
Slept in all my clothes, like I didn't care<br>
Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere<br>
I'm in if you're down to get down tonight<br>
Cause it's always a good time

Good morning and goodnight I wake up at twilight<br>
It's gonna be alright<br>
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time

Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh<br>
It's always a good time<br>
Whoa-oh-oh-oh<br>
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time

Freaked out, dropped my phone in the pool again<br>
Checked out of my room, hit the ATM<br>
Let's hang out, if you're down to get down tonight<br>
Cause it's always a good time

Good morning and goodnight<br>
I wake up at twilight<br>
It's gonna be alright<br>
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time

Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh<br>
It's always a good time<br>
Whoa-oh-oh-oh<br>
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time<br>
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh<br>
It's always a good time<br>
Whoa-oh-oh-oh<br>
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time

Doesn't matter when<br>
It's always a good time then<br>
Doesn't matter where<br>
It's always a good time there<br>
Doesn't matter when<br>
It's always a good time then

Thanks for your time.
