<div class="lyric-original">
<p>
Well its been building up inside of me<br>
For oh I don't know how long<br>
I don't know why<br>
But I keep thinking<br>
Something's bound to go wrong<br>
But she looks in my eyes<br>
And makes me realize<br>
And she says "Don't worry baby"<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Everything will turn out alright<br>
<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
<br>
I guess I should've kept my mouth shut<br>
When I started to brag about my car<br>
But I can't back down now because<br>
I pushed the other guys too far<br>
She makes me come alive<br>
And makes me wanna drive<br>
When she says "Don't worry baby"<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Everything will turn out alright<br>
<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
<br>
She told me "Baby, when you race today<br>
Just take along my love with you<br>
And if you knew how much I loved you<br>
Baby nothing could go wrong with you"<br>
Oh what she does to me<br>
When she makes love to me<br>
And she says "Don't worry baby"<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Everything will turn out alright<br>
<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby

<div class="lyric-translation">
<blockquote>
好吧它已經存在於我心裏<br>
因為 哦 我不知道多久了<br>
我不知道為什麼<br>
但我一直在思考<br>
某些東西一定會出問題<br>
但她看著我的眼睛<br>
並讓我意識到<br>
她說“別擔心寶貝”<br>
別擔心寶貝<br>
別擔心寶貝<br>
一切都會好起來的<br>
<br>
別擔心寶貝<br>
別擔心寶貝<br>
別擔心寶貝<br>
<br>
我想我應該閉上我的嘴<br>
當我開始吹噓我的汽車時<br>
但我現在不能回去因為<br>
我已經甩掉其他人很遠了<br>
她讓我活著<br>
並讓我想要兜風<br>
當她說“別擔心寶貝”<br>
別擔心寶貝<br>
別擔心寶貝<br>
一切都會好起來的<br>
<br>
別擔心寶貝<br>
別擔心寶貝<br>
別擔心寶貝<br>
<br>
她告訴我“寶貝，在你今天參賽時<br>
帶上我對你的愛<br>
如果你知道我有多愛你<br>
寶貝你不會出任何問題”<br>
哦 她對我做了什麼<br>
當她愛上我時<br>
她說“別擔心寶貝”<br>
別擔心寶貝<br>
別擔心寶貝<br>
一切都會好起來的<br>
<br>
別擔心寶貝<br>
別擔心寶貝<br>
別擔心寶貝
