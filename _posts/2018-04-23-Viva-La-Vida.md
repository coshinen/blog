## Viva La Vida | 活在當下（為生命歡呼）

I used to rule the world<br>
Seas would rise when I gave the word<br>
Now in the morning I sleep alone<br>
Sweep the streets I used to own<br>
I used to roll the dice<br>
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes<br>
Listen as the crowd would sing<br>
Now the old King is dead, long live the King<br>
One minute I held the key<br>
Next the walls were closed on me<br>
And I discovered that my castles stand<br>
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand<br>
<br>
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing<br>
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing<br>
Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
For some reason I can't explain<br>
Once you'd gone there was never<br>
Never an honest word<br>
And that was when I ruled the world<br>
<br>
It was the wicked and wild wind<br>
Blew down the doors to let me in<br>
Shattered windows and the sound of drums<br>
People couldn't believe what I'd become<br>
Revolutionaries wait<br>
For my head on a silver plate<br>
Just a puppet on a lonely string<br>
Oh who would ever want to be king?<br>
<br>
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing<br>
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing<br>
Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
For some reason I can't explain<br>
I know Saint Peter won't call my name<br>
Never an honest word<br>
But that was when I ruled the world<br>
<br>
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing<br>
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing<br>
Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
For some reason I can't explain<br>
I know Saint Peter won't call my name<br>
Never an honest word<br>
But that was when I ruled the world

Thanks for your time.
