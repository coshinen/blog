## Let It Be | 順其自然

歌手：The Beatles<br>
作詞：John lennon & Paul McCartney<br>
作曲：John lennon & Paul McCartney

When I find myself in times of trouble<br>
Mother Mary comes to me<br>
Speaking words of wisdom<br>
Let it be

And in my hour of darkness<br>
She is standing right in front of me<br>
Speaking words of wisdom<br>
Let it be

Let it be, let it be<br>
Let it be, let it be<br>
Whisper words of wisdom<br>
Let it be

And when the broken-hearted people<br>
Living in the world agree<br>
There will be an answer<br>
Let it be

For though they may be parted<br>
There is still a chance that they will see<br>
There will be an answer<br>
Let it be

Let it be, let it be<br>
Let it be, let it be<br>
There will be an answer<br>
Let it be

Let it be, let it be<br>
Let it be, let it be<br>
Whisper words of wisdom<br>
Let it be

And when the night is cloudy<br>
There is still a light that shined on me<br>
Shine until tomorrow<br>
Let it be

I wake up to the sound of music<br>
Mother Mary comes to me<br>
Speaking words of wisdom<br>
Let it be

Let it be, let it be<br>
Let it be, let it be<br>
There will be an answer<br>
Let it be

Let it be, let it be<br>
Let it be, let it be<br>
Whisper words of wisdom<br>
Let it be

Thanks for your time.
