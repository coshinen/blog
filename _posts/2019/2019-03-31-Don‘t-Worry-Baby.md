Singer: The Beach Boys<br>
Songwriters: Brian Wilson & Roger Christian

<div class="lyric-original">
<p>
Well its been building up inside of me<br>
For oh I don't know how long<br>
I don't know why<br>
But I keep thinking<br>
Something's bound to go wrong<br>
But she looks in my eyes<br>
And makes me realize<br>
And she says "Don't worry baby"<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Everything will turn out alright<br>
<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
<br>
I guess I should've kept my mouth shut<br>
When I started to brag about my car<br>
But I can't back down now because<br>
I pushed the other guys too far<br>
She makes me come alive<br>
And makes me wanna drive<br>
When she says "Don't worry baby"<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Everything will turn out alright<br>
<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
<br>
She told me "Baby, when you race today<br>
Just take along my love with you<br>
And if you knew how much I loved you<br>
Baby nothing could go wrong with you"<br>
Oh what she does to me<br>
When she makes love to me<br>
And she says "Don't worry baby"<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Everything will turn out alright<br>
<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby

<div class="lyric-translation">
<blockquote>
好吧它已经存在于我心里<br>
因为 哦 我不知道多久了<br>
我不知道为什么<br>
但我一直在思考<br>
某些东西一定会出问题<br>
但她看着我的眼睛<br>
并让我意识到<br>
她说“别担心宝贝”<br>
别担心宝贝<br>
别担心宝贝<br>
一切都会好起来的<br>
<br>
别担心宝贝<br>
别担心宝贝<br>
别担心宝贝<br>
<br>
我想我应该闭上我的嘴<br>
当我开始吹嘘我的汽车时<br>
但我现在不能回去因为<br>
我已经甩掉其他人很远了<br>
她让我活着<br>
并让我想要兜风<br>
当她说“别担心宝贝”<br>
别担心宝贝<br>
别担心宝贝<br>
一切都会好起来的<br>
<br>
别担心宝贝<br>
别担心宝贝<br>
别担心宝贝<br>
<br>
她告诉我“宝贝，在你今天参赛时<br>
带上我对你的爱<br>
如果你知道我有多爱你<br>
宝贝你不会出任何问题”<br>
哦 她对我做了什么<br>
当她爱上我时<br>
她说“别担心宝贝”<br>
别担心宝贝<br>
别担心宝贝<br>
一切都会好起来的<br>
<br>
别担心宝贝<br>
别担心宝贝<br>
别担心宝贝
