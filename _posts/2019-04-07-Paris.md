excerpt: We were staying in Paris, to get away from your parents. And I thought, “Wow if I could take this in a shot right now, I don't think that we could work this out”. Out on the terrace. I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How could I let you fall by yourself, while I'm wasted with someone else?”

We were staying in Paris<br>
To get away from your parents<br>
And I thought, “Wow<br>
If I could take this in a shot right now<br>
I don't think that we could work this out”<br>
Out on the terrace<br>
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How<br>
Could I let you fall by yourself<br>
While I'm wasted with someone else?”

If we go down then we go down together<br>
They'll say you could do anything<br>
They'll say that I was clever<br>
If we go down then we go down together<br>
We'll get away with everything<br>
Let's show them we are better<br>
Let's show them we are better<br>
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris<br>
To get away from your parents<br>
You look so proud<br>
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette<br>
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet<br>
Out on the terrace<br>
We breathe in the air of this small town<br>
On our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it<br>
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

If we go down then we go down together<br>
They'll say you could do anything<br>
They'll say that I was clever<br>
If we go down then we go down together<br>
We'll get away with everything<br>
Let's show them we are better

Let's show them we are<br>
Show them we are<br>
Let's show them we are<br>
Show them we are<br>
Let's show them we are better<br>
We were staying in Paris<br>
Let's show them we are better<br>
Let's show them we are<br>
Show them we are<br>
Let's show them we are<br>
Show them we are<br>
Let's show them we are better

If we go down then we go down together<br>
They'll say you could do anything<br>
They'll say that I was clever<br>
If we go down then we go down together<br>
We'll get away with everything<br>
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris (If we go down)<br>
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)<br>
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)<br>
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)<br>
Let's show them we are better<br>
We were staying in Paris

Let's show them we are better<br>
Let's show them we are better<br>
If we go down<br>
Let's show them we are better<br>
If we go down<br>
Let's show them we are better<br>
If we go down

Thanks for your time.
