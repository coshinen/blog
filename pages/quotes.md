---
> Paul Graham, [What You'll Wish You'd Known](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html){:target="_blank"}:
> * Fouls happen. The thing to do when you get fouled is not to lose your cool.
> Just keep playing.
> * There's no switch inside you that magically flips when you turn a certain
> age or graduate from some institution. You start being an adult when you
> decide to take responsibility for your life. You can do that at any age.

> Steve Jobs, [Text of Steve Jobs' Commencement address (2005)](https://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/14/jobs-061505){:target="_blank"}:
> * Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be
> trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's
> thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner
> voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and
> intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything
> else is secondary.
> * Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.

> Linus Torvalds, [Re: SCO: "thread creation is about a thousand times faster than on native Linux"](https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/8/25/132){:target="_blank"}:
> * Talk is cheap. Show me the code.

> Satoshi Nakamoto, [Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper](https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014853.html){:target="_blank"}:
> * It's very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it
> properly. I'm better with code than with words though.

> Carl Jung, [C.G. Jung Letters, Vol. 1: 1906-1950, Page 33](https://carljungdepthpsychologysite.blog/2020/02/08/carl-jung-i-am-afraid-that-the-mere-fact-of-my-presence-takes-you-away-from-yourself/){:target="_blank"}:
> * Who looks outside dreams; who looks inside awakes.

> Benjamin Franklin, The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, PART THREE:
> * This is another instance of the truth of an old maxim I had learned, which
> says, "He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you
> another, than he whom you yourself have obliged." And it shows how much more
> profitable it is prudently to remove, than to resent, return, and continue
> inimical proceedings.

> George Orwell, As I Please 1943-1945, [Benefit of Clergy: Some Notes on Salvador Dali](https://www.orwell.ru/library/reviews/dali/english/e_dali){:target="_blank"}:
> * Autobiography is only to be trusted when it reveals something disgraceful. A
> man who gives a good account of himself is probably lying, since any life when
> viewed from the inside is simply a series of defeats.

> Egaeus, [Short Fiction, Berenice](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edgar-allan-poe/short-fiction/text/berenice){:target="_blank"}:
> * But as, in ethics, evil is a consequence of good, so, in fact, out of joy is
> sorrow born. Either the memory of past bliss is the anguish of today, or the
> agonies which are, have their origin in the ecstasies which might have been.

> 加賀恭一郎「新参者 第2話 料亭の小僧」：
> * 嘘には三種類ある。一、自分を守る嘘。二、他人を欺く嘘。三、他人を庇う嘘だ。

> 倉沢さつき(和辻摩子)「Wの悲劇 第二幕 資産2000億の女帝」：
> * 人は、見たいものしか見ないし、信じたいものしか…信じないですから。

> 橘カラ(十和田幸)「サイレーン 刑事×彼女×完全悪女 第1話 完全悪女が僕の彼女を獲物にした」：
> * 信頼を得るにはふたつ。役に立つと思われること。それと弱みをさらすこと。

> 怨み屋「怨み屋本舗 第八回 ハートキャッチャー」：
> * 嘘をつかない人間なんて、どこにもいないわ。
> 嘘をどう利用するか、それが問題なんだけよ。

> 竜ヶ崎桃子「下妻物語」：
> * 人間は、大きな幸せを前にすると、急に臆病になる。
> 幸せを勝ち取ることは、不幸に耐えることより勇気が要るの。

> 宇佐美博人「サバイバル ウェディング 最終話 結婚か？仕事か？幸せはどっちだ！？」：
> * 大切なのは、どんな選択をするかじゃない！
> 自分が選択した人生を強く生きるかどうか！ただそれだけだ！

> 宮崎駿「終わらない人 宮崎駿」：
> * まあ、もうオレいま世の中に合わせて生きる気ないから。
