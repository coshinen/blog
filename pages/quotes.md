> Paul Graham, [What You'll Wish You'd Known](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html){:target="_blank"}:
> * The best protection is always to be working on hard problems. Writing novels
> is hard. Reading novels isn't. Hard means worry: if you're not worrying that
> something you're making will come out badly, or that you won't be able to
> understand something you're studying, then it isn't hard enough. There has to
> be suspense.
> * Fouls happen. The thing to do when you get fouled is not to lose your cool.
> Just keep playing.
> * Your life doesn't have to be shaped by admissions officers. It could be
> shaped by your own curiosity. It is for all ambitious adults. And you don't
> have to wait to start. In fact, you don't have to wait to be an adult. There's
> no switch inside you that magically flips when you turn a certain age or
> graduate from some institution. You start being an adult when you decide to
> take responsibility for your life. You can do that at any age.

> Steve Jobs, [Text of Steve Jobs' Commencement address (2005)](https://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/14/jobs-061505){:target="_blank"}:
> * Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be
> trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's
> thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner
> voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and
> intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything
> else is secondary.
> * Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.

> Linus Torvalds, [Re: log-buf-len dynamic](https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/9/23/215){:target="_blank"}, [Reference](https://shlomif.livejournal.com/39215.html){:target="_blank"}:

> Linus Torvalds, [Re: SCO: "thread creation is about a thousand times faster than on native Linux"](https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/8/25/132){:target="_blank"}:
> * Talk is cheap. Show me the code.

> Satoshi Nakamoto, [Scalability and transaction rate](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6306#msg6306){:target="_blank"}:
> * If you don't believe it or don't get it, I don't have the time to try to
> convince you, sorry.

> Satoshi Nakamoto, [Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper](https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/014853.html){:target="_blank"}:

> to study.

> that no one can imagine.

> * Who looks outside dreams; who looks inside awakes.

> Benjamin Franklin, The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, PART THREE:
> * This is another instance of the truth of an old maxim I had learned, which
> says, "He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you
> another, than he whom you yourself have obliged." And it shows how much more
> profitable it is prudently to remove, than to resent, return, and continue
> inimical proceedings.

> George Orwell, [Looking back on the Spanish War](https://orwell.ru/library/essays/Spanish_War/english/esw_1){:target="_blank"}:
> * This kind of thing is frightening to me, because it often gives me the
> feeling that the very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world.
> After all, the chances are that those lies, or at any rate similar lies, will
> pass into history...
> Yet, after all, some kind of history will be written, and after those who
> actually remember the war are dead, it will be universally accepted. So for
> all practical purposes the lie will have become truth.

> George Orwell, As I Please 1943-1945, [Benefit of Clergy: Some Notes on Salvador Dali](https://www.orwell.ru/library/reviews/dali/english/e_dali){:target="_blank"}:

> man who gives a good account of himself is probably lying, since any life when
> viewed from the inside is simply a series of defeats.

> sorrow born. Either the memory of past bliss is the anguish of today, or the
> agonies which are, have their origin in the ecstasies which might have been.

> 永里大介「家族ノカタチ 第1話 結婚しない息子と娘vs超破天荒な父と母」：

> * 人間は、大きな幸せを前にすると、急に臆病になる。
