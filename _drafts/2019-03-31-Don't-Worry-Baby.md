## Don't Worry Baby | 別擔心寶貝

歌手：The Beach Boys<br>
作詞：Brian Wilson・Roger Christian<br>
作曲：Brian Wilson・Roger Christian

Well its been building up inside of me<br>
For oh I don't know how long<br>
I don't know why<br>
But I keep thinking<br>
Something's bound to go wrong<br>
But she looks in my eyes<br>
And makes me realize<br>
And she says "Don't worry baby"<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Everything will turn out alright

Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby

> 別擔心寶貝<br>
> 別擔心寶貝<br>
> 別擔心寶貝

I guess I should've kept my mouth shut<br>
When I started to brag about my car<br>
But I can't back down now because<br>
I pushed the other guys too far<br>
She makes me come alive<br>
And makes me wanna drive<br>
When she says "Don't worry baby"<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Everything will turn out alright

Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby

> 別擔心寶貝<br>
> 別擔心寶貝<br>
> 別擔心寶貝

She told me "Baby, when you race today<br>
Just take along my love with you<br>
And if you knew how much I loved you<br>
Baby nothing could go wrong with you"<br>
Oh what she does to me<br>
When she makes love to me<br>
And she says "Don't worry baby"<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Everything will turn out alright

Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby<br>
Don't worry baby

> 別擔心寶貝<br>
> 別擔心寶貝<br>
> 別擔心寶貝

Thanks for your time.
